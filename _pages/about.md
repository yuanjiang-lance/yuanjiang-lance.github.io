**Hi, I'm glad you're here!** 

I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pingfeng Wang](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pingfeng). I'm deeply committed to harnessing the power of <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">physics-informed machine learning</span> and <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color);">digital twin</span> technologies to build smarter, safer, and more reliable engineering systems. My work broadly contributes to prognostics and health managment (PHM) and reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) -- pushing the boundaries of how we monitor, predict, and optimize the performance of complex physical systems.

Before joining UIUC, I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Vehicle Engineering from the Institute of Rail Transit at Tongji University, where I worked with [Prof. Gang Niu](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10978.htm) on advanced signal processing for mechatronic transmission fault diagnosis and structural health monitoring. 

I enjoy solving physics-driven engineering problems with data-efficient, model-aware AI tools. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student, or just someone curious about my work, feel free to browse around and reach out if anything interests you.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
