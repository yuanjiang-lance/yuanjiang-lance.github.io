**Hi, I'm glad you're here!** 

I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at the [Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pingfeng Wang](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pingfeng). Prior to UIUC, I received both my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Vehicle Engineering from the [Institute of Rail Transit](https://railway.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Gang Niu](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2943/10978.htm).

My research broadly contributes to **prognostics and health management (PHM)** and **reliability-based design optimization (RBDO)**, with a particular focus on closing the gap between high-fidelity physics-based models and data-limited real-world systems.I'm deeply committed to harnessing the power of **scientific machine learning** and **digital twin** technologies to build **model-aware and data-efficient methods** that integrate physical laws, numerical simulations, and learning-based models, enabling smarter, safer, and more reliable engineering systems in aerospace propulsion, energy storage, and mechatronic transmissions. 

I enjoy solving physics-driven engineering problems with data-limited, model-aware AI tools. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student, or just someone curious about my work, feel free to browse around and reach out if anything interests you.

## Research Interests

1. **Scientific machine learning**: physics-informed machine learning, neural operator, generative model
2. **Digital twin**: finite-element simulation, plasma dynamics, multi-fidelity modeling and data fusion
3. **Prognostics and health management**: advanced signal processing, condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, remaining useful life prediction
4. **Reliability-based design optimization**: Bayesian methods, reliability analysis, uncertainty quantification
