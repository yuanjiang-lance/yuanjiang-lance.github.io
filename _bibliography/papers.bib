  abstract={The layout of battery cells in liquid-based battery thermal management systems determines the temperature distribution within a battery pack, which, in turn, affects the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the battery system. Therefore, real-time heat map prediction is of great importance for battery design optimization and control strategy refinement. However, the scarcity of high-fidelity data as well as the imperfections of low-fidelity physics knowledge significantly hinder the accuracy of both data-driven and physic-informed machine learning (PIML) surrogate models. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-fidelity physics-informed convolutional neural network (MFPI-CNN) that integrates low-fidelity domain-specific knowledge with limited high-fidelity data to provide accurate and trustworthy real-time battery heat map estimations. First, to facilitate the integration of heat transfer knowledge into machine learning models, a complex three-dimensional battery heat transfer problem is simplified to an equivalent two-dimensional representation as low-fidelity physics knowledge. Then, the MFPI-CNN with a physics-informed backbone and a high-fidelity projection head is proposed to generate battery heat maps at various fidelity levels. The backbone’s pre-training employs an unsupervised PIML framework, embedding heat transfer partial differential equations and boundary conditions within the loss function and padding modes. The high-fidelity projection head with a simplified structure is then appended to the fixed backbone and trained by limited labeled data. Both the backbone and projection head are equipped with appropriate modules and linear-weighting loss functions to normalize convergence speed. The efficacy of the model simplification is verified by various battery experiments and simulations. Comparative results and ablation studies on heat map predictions demonstrate that the proposed MFPI-CNN outperforms traditional data-driven, physics-informed, and other multi-fidelity surrogate models.},

  abstract={Hall thrusters, a type of propulsion device with high specific impulses, have gathered substantial interest within the aerospace community. However, the challenge of thruster wall erosion induced by sputtering impedes their stable and reliable function. This paper proposes a novel prognostic framework for estimating Hall thruster channel wall erosion based on multiphysics simulation and machine learning. First, a one-dimensional (1D) plasma discharge code is introduced to simulate plasma dynamics within discharge channel. Then, the erosion rate is quantified based on a semi-empirical sputter yield model. In addition, an erosion profile estimation loop is proposed to accommodate the 1D simulation while leveraging 2D erosion profiles. Finally, a machine-learning polynomial regression model serves as a surrogate model, facilitating efficient erosion rate estimations without extensive computations. Results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed low-fidelity prognostic framework reliably reflects the erosion trends observed in high-fidelity models and experimental data, while reducing both simulation and testing requirements.},

  abstract={With the popularity of electric vehicles, the demand for lithium-ion batteries is increasing. Temperature significantly influences batteries' performance and safety. Battery thermal management systems can effectively control the temperature of batteries; therefore, batteries' performance and safety can be ensured. However, the development process of battery thermal management systems is time-consuming and costly due to the extensive training dataset needed by data-driven models requiring enormous computational costs for finite element analysis. Therefore, a new approach to constructing surrogate models is needed in the era of AI. Physics-informed machine learning enforces the physical laws in surrogate models, making it the perfect candidate for estimating battery pack temperature distribution. In this study, we first developed a 21700 battery pack indirect liquid cooling system with cold plates on the top and bottom with thermal paste surrounding the battery cells. Then, the simplified finite element model was built based on experiment results. Due to the high coolant flow rate, the cold plates can be considered as constant temperature boundaries, while battery cells are the heat sources. The physics-informed convolutional neural network served as a surrogate model to estimate the temperature distribution of the battery pack. The loss function was constructed considering the heat conduction equation based on the finite difference method. The physics-informed loss function helped the convergence of the training process with less data. As a result, the physics-informed convolutional neural network showed more than 15% improvement in accuracy compared to the data-driven method with the same training data.},

  abstract={This paper presents a comparison study of multiple feature extractors adapted from popular deep learning models for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) in predicting remaining useful lives (RULs). The study focuses on the ability of these feature extractors in developing a domain- adversarial neural network to solve the domain shift problem in predicting RULs on unlabeled new datasets. The feature extractors are trained on the same labeled dataset and the extracted features are then fed into a benchmark regression model to predict the RUL values, therefore analyzing their applicability and effectiveness in transfer learning for PHM applications. The training and the evaluation studies have also been performed on the NASA turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset, which has four subsets each with different operating condition settings and failure modes thus having different marginal distribution of data. The evaluation phase consists of two experiments. In the first experiment, the accuracy of models with different feature extractors is evaluated by comparing the root mean square error values of the predicted RUL across various test subsets. The second experiment includes predicting the entire sequence of RULs of one engine until failure. These two case studies provide valuable insights about how different models handle varying degrees of domain shifts and their potential for accurate and reliable predictions in practical PHM applications.},

  abstract={The popularity of transportation electrification has increased the demand for battery thermal management systems. Among different battery thermal management systems, indirect liquid cooling is a promising candidate to ensure systems' performance, safety, and reliability. Temperature uniformity is important for systems' safety and needs to be optimized. However, the optimization process for indirect liquid cooling is prolonged due to the complexity of the system. Though finite element simulation can greatly save efforts on experimental testing, the computational cost required by the finite element simulation is high, especially for generating a large training dataset for constructing the surrogate model. Thus, adapting physics-informed machine learning to accelerate the optimization process is crucial. By integrating physics-informed loss functions into the surrogate model, together with the optimization framework, the battery thermal management systems can be improved. Based on the developed experimental testing and the high-fidelity multiphysics finite element model, the geometry can be simplified, and the complexity of the problem can be reduced. Based on the simplified heat conduction function, a physics-informed convolutional neural network was developed as a surrogate model to estimate the temperature distribution of the battery pack. This network contains a loss function considering the heat conduction equation based on the finite difference method, helping the convergence of the training process with less data. Finally, the optimal battery layout designs were obtained based on the two different optimization algorithms, showing a 7.2% improvement in temperature uniformity for the battery cells, improving the battery pack's performance and safety.},

  abstract={Time series models are effective in extracting periodic and trend properties from time series like gearbox vibration signals. However, gearboxes often operate under variable speed conditions which makes the vibration signal non-stationary. This paper proposes a sparse linear parameter-varying autoregressive moving average (Spa LPV-ARMA) model for non-stationary vibration representation. Gearbox fault detection under variable speed conditions can be achieved by examining model residuals. The proposed model combines the advantages of sparse time series modeling with ARMA modeling, and therefore can capture unforeseen random fluctuations and unexpected events in the data. Simulation and experimental studies are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed Spa LPV-ARMA model. Comprehensive comparisons with classical indicators, order spectra, envelope order spectra, ARIMA model, and Spa LPV-AR model are made. The results have shown that the Spa LPV-ARMA model performs best in both modeling and fault detection accuracy.},

  abstract={Fault detection in mechatronic transmissions is particularly challenging due to the nonstationary nature of monitoring signals arising from complex operating conditions, coupled with the high-safety requirements that limit the availability of fault data. Sparse linear parameter varying autoregressive moving average (Spa LPV-ARMA) model is a powerful tool for dealing with nonstationary time series, and good fitting results can be achieved through the basis function expansion, where parameters of the model are associated with additional variables. However, current research on Spa LPV-ARMA model only considers single basis function, overlooking the potential complementarity of multiple basis functions. This article proposes a novel enhanced Spa LPV-ARMA model with ensemble basis for mechatronic transmission fault detection. The proposed model incorporates the concept of ensemble learning by combining models with different basis functions, and a stepwise approach is utilized to select the models to be combined. The rational choice of the combination scale allows the ensemble model to have fewer parameters with higher accuracy. Simulation and experimental studies in mechatronic transmission are conducted, verifying that the proposed ensemble basis Spa LPV-ARMA model exhibits higher modeling accuracy and fault detection performance.},

For example, stereolithography (SLA) has become a promising candidate for the mass production of energy absorption architected cellular materials due to its capability to fabricate complex material designs with advantageous characteristics. As stereolithography is being applied in different industrial settings, uncertainties become a critical factor that influences the performance of the products. As a solution, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is needed to understand the impact of uncertainties on the overall performance variability of the design and inform decision-makers to enhance system robustness and reliability better. This paper presented a novel framework for accelerated uncertainty quantification based on integrating physics-based computational modeling and data-driven surrogate models. The high-fidelity finite element model can be built and validated based on experimental tests. With an adaptive sampling technique, the surrogate model can be built with fewer expensive simulation runs while achieving a desirable modeling accuracy, saving the computational cost.

Specifically, an improved VKF model is developed with the consideration of nonlinear initial phase and discrepancies between true and estimated IFs.

  abstract={Dispersive signals are omnipresent in structural health monitoring and nondestructive testing. Due to the strong dispersion and multimodal characteristics, such signals often contain multiple components with frequency-varying group delays (GDs) overlapping in time–frequency (TF) domain, bringing great challenges to the existing signal processing methods. This paper presents a novel dispersive signal decomposition method named iterative frequency-domain envelope-tracking filter (IFETF) to accurately estimate the dispersion curves and separate overlapped components. Specifically, an envelope tracking issue is introduced in frequency domain based on dispersive signal model. Then, GDs are refined by recovered frequency envelope, and an iterative processing procedure is designed to ameliorate the TF resolution. To initialize the IFETF, an adaptive ridge detection technique is introduced to automatically estimate the number of components and their GDs with little prior knowledge. In addition, a high-quality TF representation can be constructed according to the results of IFETF, unambiguously revealing TF patterns of a multi-component dispersive signal. The proposed method was demonstrated by numerical analysis and engineering applications on broadband Lamb wave inspection and rail damage detection. Compared with traditional TF analysis techniques, the results show that the IFETF provides higher accuracy and efficiency in signal reconstruction and GD estimation.},

Conventional order tracking is performed with a reference signal measured by the auxiliary device, which is expensive and inconvenient to install. In order to to break the constraint of the traditional order tracking technique, some tacholess order tracking methods have been developed in the past few years. However, current tacholess order tracking approaches are only applicable to slightly varying speed applications. To overcome the shortcoming above, a novel tacholess order tracking method is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, each mode of the vibration signal is reconstructed by a method called extended intrinsic chirp component decomposition, and the Hilbert transform is used to estimate the instantaneous phase of reference shaft. Then the vibration signal is resampled to the angle domain, and the fault characteristic orders can be identified in the order spectrum accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by a simulated meshing gear vibration signal. The result illustrates that the proposed method can realize gears fault diagnosis under large speed variation conditions.},
